# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I (Nathaniel Brough) am a mechatronics engineer and work primarily in R&D. I am passionate about the natural world, technology and open-source!!

I am an avid diver, surfer, kiter, climber, hiker... All the outside things.

You can often find me down by a river or beach, with my laptop balanced atop a camp-table with a mega-power bank, so I can get my laptop to last through the day.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a fuzzing framework for embedded-hal Rust drivers.

# Need help?
So you've been using some of my code and found it useful, but you need help...
- Open an issue/feature request: I'll get to it when I have spare time. If I'm unlikely to get to it in a reasonable amount of time, I'll be happy to coach you through doing it yourself and creating a PR etc.
- I need "*Awesome feature X*"/"*I need terrible bug X fixed*" ASAP: **Hire me!** my contact details can be found on my profile or by running `git log`, on any of my repos.
