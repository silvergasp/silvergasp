# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I (Nathaniel Brough) am a mechatronics engineer and work primarily in R&D. I am passionate about the natural world, technology and open-source!!

I am an avid diver, surfer, kiter, climber, hiker... All the outside things.

You can often find me down by a river or beach, with my laptop balanced atop a camp-table with a mega-power bank, so I can get my laptop to last through the day.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a fuzzing framework for embedded-hal Rust drivers.
